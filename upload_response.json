This role is paramount for establishing robust cloud abstraction layers, architecting advanced solutions like Kubernetes stretch clusters, and ensuring a scalable and resilient OSS deployment architecture. Your expertise will be instrumental in guiding our cloud transformation, optimizing infrastructure costs, and enabling the rapid, secure, and reliable deployment of our critical OSS products across diverse cloud environments. PRINCIPLE RESPONSIBILITIES: Multi-DC & Hybrid Cloud Strategy Define and evolve the enterprise-wide multi-datacentre and hybrid cloud architectural strategy, aligning with business continuity, disaster recovery, and data locality requirements. Develop architectural patterns and guidelines for deploying and managing OSS applications across public cloud, private cloud, and on-premises environments. Evaluate and recommend cloud technologies, platforms, and services that best fit our architectural vision and operational needs. Cloud Abstraction & Kubernetes Excellence Design and promote cloud abstraction layers to ensure application portability and reduce vendor lock-in. Lead the architecture of advanced Kubernetes deployments, including considerations for stretch clusters, multi-cluster management, and highly available control planes. Ensure Kubernetes infrastructure is optimized for performance, scalability, and cost efficiency for OSS workloads. Scalable OSS Deployment Architecture Architect highly scalable, resilient, and fault-tolerant deployment models for our OSS product portfolio across various cloud footprints. Define patterns for automated provisioning, configuration management, and infrastructure as code (IaC) within cloud environments. Ensure architectural designs meet stringent non-functional requirements such as security, compliance, observability, and cost efficiency. Technical Leadership & Governance Provide senior technical leadership and guidance to product teams, engineering, and operations on cloud best practices, architectural patterns, and strategic technology choices. Participate in architectural review boards, ensuring cloud designs align with enterprise standards and strategic objectives. Conduct proof-of-concepts (POCs) for new cloud technologies and evaluate their suitability for our ecosystem. Cost Optimization & Operational Efficiency Design architectures that inherently optimize cloud infrastructure costs without compromising performance or reliability. Work with operations teams to define operational models and tools for managing cloud deployments at scale. REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE: 10+ years of hands-on experience in enterprise architecture, with at least 5 years dedicated to cloud architecture in complex, large-scale environments. Proven track record of designing and implementing multi-datacentre and hybrid cloud strategies. Deep expertise in Kubernetes and its ecosystem, including advanced deployment patterns (e.g., stretch clusters, federation). Strong background in architecting scalable and resilient distributed systems for critical applications like OSS. Expert-level knowledge of at least one major public cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and strong familiarity with others. Deep understanding of cloud networking (VPCs, VPNs, Direct Connect/ExpressRoute), security (IAM, network security groups, WAF), and cost management. Proficiency with containerization technologies (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes). Strong experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible). Knowledge of cloud-native observability stacks (monitoring, logging, tracing). Understanding of modern CI/CD practices in a cloud context. Familiarity with virtualization technologies (e.g., VMware, OpenStack).","jobSkills":["docker","kubernetes","aws","gcp","azure","terraform","ansible"],"manualCertificates":[],"credlyStatus":{"attempted":false,"success":false,"manualEntryRequired":false,"message":""},"classification":{"isResume":false,"description":"a document starting with \"Dummy PDF file\"","className":"non_resume","confidence":0.3,"reason":"The text lacks resume-defining sections such as Experience, Education, or Skills.","accepted":true,"evaluatedAt":"2025-12-08T10:26:06.659Z","overridden":true},"sessionPointer":{"sessionId":"be2d05b0-91b5-467d-b760-ae457b2a40fd","bucket":"resume-forge-data-ats","prefix":"cv/dummy_pdf/be2d05b0-91b5-467d-b760-ae457b2a40fd/","changeLogKey":"cv/dummy_pdf/be2d05b0-91b5-467d-b760-ae457b2a40fd/logs/change-log.json","s3Location":"s3://resume-forge-data-ats/cv/dummy_pdf/be2d05b0-91b5-467d-b760-ae457b2a40fd/"},"upload":{"bucket":"resume-forge-data-ats","key":"cv/dummy_pdf/be2d05b0-91b5-467d-b760-ae457b2a40fd/original.pdf","metadataKey":"cv/dummy_pdf/be2d05b0-91b5-467d-b760-ae457b2a40fd/logs/log.json","logKey":"cv/dummy_pdf/be2d05b0-91b5-467d-b760-ae457b2a40fd/logs/processing.jsonl","sessionChangeLogKey":"cv/dummy_pdf/be2d05b0-91b5-467d-b760-ae457b2a40fd/logs/change-log.json"}}
